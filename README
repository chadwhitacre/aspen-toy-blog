To get it running, clone or download, and then start aspen inside of this
directory. Hit http://localhost:8080/ and you will see a "New Post" button. Hit
that and enter a slug and then hit "Edit" to add content. "Save" and you'll see
your content. "Save" with empty fields to delete. Go back to the homepage and
you'll see it listed there.

Check the source code to unravel how Aspen works.
